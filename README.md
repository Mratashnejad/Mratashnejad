### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

its Me Alireza Atashnejad 

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer software and technology. I have two years of experience in implementing web applications using python programming language.

Ai and Machine learning systems and collaborating with others to improve the overall design are what I always long for. I have experience in Machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow, OpenCV, Pandas, and Numpy.

I have special interests in designing web applications and automated websites and building tools and frameworks. I work individually on several projects uploaded on my GitHub but I haven't experienced working in a team on programming. I know very well the basics of python - OOP - Django - Djangorestframework API - Git and have familiarity with AWS and Docker. I have a good reputation on Stackoverflow as well.

My goal is to continue my career as a software engineer in this area in an agile development team with developers and designers in a comprehensive, efficient, and well-organized way in Artificial intelligence, Data Science.

Python Django API rest framework

Full-stack developer, Ai, ML Django, React.js, MongoDB
